### 2.2 Debate Timer & Recording Interface

#### Main Timer Screen
```
Layout:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Motion: [Display motion text]      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Current Speaker:                   │
│  [Name] - [Team] - [Position]       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│         [00:00]                     │
│      (Large Timer)                  │
│                                     │
│    🔴 REC (indicator when active)   │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [START/STOP Button]                │
│                                     │
│  [< Previous] [Next Speaker >]      │
│                                     │
│  Progress: Speaker 2/6              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Timer Behavior
- **START pressed**:
  - Timer begins counting up
  - Audio recording starts automatically in background
  - REC indicator lights up

- **Bell Notifications**:
  - At **1:00** → 1 bell (ding)
  - At **[Time - 1:00]** → 1 bell (e.g., at 4:00 for 5-min speech)
  - At **[Time]** → 2 bells (ding-ding)
  - Every **15 seconds after** → 3 bells (ding-ding-ding)

- **STOP pressed** or **Swipe Right**:
  - Timer stops
  - Recording stops
  - Audio file saved locally with naming: `{debate_id}_{speaker_name}_{position}_{timestamp}.m4a`
  - Upload to backend initiated immediately
  - Progress indicator shows upload status
  - Move to next speaker automatically

- **Swipe Left**: Go back to previous speaker (if needed)

#### Background Recording Requirements
- **Format**: M4A or AAC (compressed, good quality)
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz or 48kHz
- **Channels**: Mono (sufficient for speech)
- **Quality**: Balance between file size and clarity (suggest 128kbps)

---

### 2.3 Real-time Upload & Processing

#### Upload Logic
```javascript
On STOP button press:
1. Finalize audio recording
2. Save file locally with metadata:
   {
     debate_id: UUID,
     speaker_name: string,
     speaker_position: string (e.g., "Prop 1", "OG 1"),
     motion: string,
     duration_seconds: number,
     timestamp: ISO8601,
     student_level: "primary" | "secondary"
   }
3. Start upload to backend endpoint: POST /api/debates/{debate_id}/speeches
4. Show upload progress (0-100%)
5. On success: Mark as uploaded, show checkmark
6. On failure: Retry 3 times, then alert user
7. Keep local file until confirmed processed by backend
```

#### Offline Handling (Future - Not Current Version)
- Queue uploads when offline
- Auto-upload when connection restored

---

### 2.4 Feedback Viewing

#### Access Points
- **During Debate**: "View Feedback" button available once any speech is processed
- **After Debate**: "View All Feedback" button
- **History**: "Past Debates" tab (authenticated mode only)

#### Feedback Display
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Speaker: [Name]                    │
│  Position: [Prop 1]                 │
│  Motion: [Motion text]              │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Processing Status: ✓ Complete      │
│                                     │
│  [View Feedback Doc]                │
│  [Share Link]                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 7. Performance Requirements

- **Timer Accuracy**: ±100ms
- **Recording Start Delay**: <200ms from START press
- **Upload Initiation**: <1s after STOP press
- **UI Responsiveness**: 60fps animations
- **App Launch**: <2s cold start

---

## 8. Key Implementation Notes for Developer

### 8.1 Recording While Timing
- Use `AVAudioRecorder` for background recording
- Start recording and timer simultaneously on START press
- Handle interruptions (phone calls, etc.) gracefully

### 8.2 File Naming Convention
```
{debate_id}_{speaker_name_sanitized}_{position}_{timestamp}.m4a

Example:
abc123_john_doe_prop1_20250120143045.m4a
```

### 8.3 Upload Strategy
- Use `URLSession` with background upload configuration
- Chunked upload for larger files (if speech >5min)
- Send metadata as JSON in multipart form

### 8.4 Bell Audio Files
- Provide 3 audio files:
  - `bell_1.mp3` (single ding)
  - `bell_2.mp3` (double ding)
  - `bell_3.mp3` (triple ding)
- Use `AVAudioPlayer` for precise timing

### 8.5 Gesture Recognition
- Swipe right: Next speaker
- Swipe left: Previous speaker (with confirmation)
- Tap timer: Pause/Resume (optional feature)

---

## 9. Future Enhancements (Not Current Version)

- Offline recording with queued uploads
- Student-facing app for viewing own feedback history
- Pattern analysis across multiple debates
