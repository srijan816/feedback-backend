# Position-Specific Feedback Patterns
## Analysis of Teacher Comments by Speaker Position

> **Based on analysis of 76 secondary-level feedback documents**
>
> This document identifies how teacher feedback differs dramatically based on speaker position (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, etc.)

---

## Key Finding: Position Determines Feedback Focus

**Teacher feedback is NOT generic** - it's highly tailored to the **specific role expectations** of each speaker position. The same quality of argumentation might be praised for Position 1.1 but criticized for Position 1.4.

## Position-by-Position Breakdown

---

### Position 1.1 (First Proposition/Opposition Speaker)

**Average Comment Length:** 3,570 characters

- **Rebuttal:** 27 mentions (mostly critiquing OTHER speakers, or noting absence)
- **Signposting:** 18 mentions
- **New Arguments:** 15 mentions
- **Teamwork:** 11 mentions (lower - they're first)

**Common Feedback Patterns:**

#### 1. **Counter Set-Up is CRITICAL**

- "Excellent job clarifying what amounts to severe bullying"

#### 3. **Signposting Reminder**
- "Don't forget to signpost your speech before diving in!" (repeated almost every feedback)

#### 4. **Strategic Framing**
- "We should strategically frame bad parents out of this debate"
- "Co-opting Opp's goals of hard work and valuing education"

**What Teachers DON'T Expect:**
- ❌ Rebuttal (it's N/A for first speakers)
- ❌ Extending teammate arguments (they're the first)

**Sample Critical Feedback:**
> "is there a reason why we're analysing all of this up top instead of in your argument?"

## Summary: Position-Specific Evaluation Criteria

| Position | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus | Common Critiques |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1.1** | Counter set-up, framework, definition | Signposting, first arguments | Diving in without signposting, weak framework |
| **1.2** | Extending first speaker, teamwork | Strategic framing, new arguments | Not referencing first speaker, contradictions |
| **1.3 (Reply)** | Weighing, clash, summary | Reinforcement of key points | Information dumps, no comparative analysis |
| **1.3 (Regular)** | Rebuttal, new arguments | Teamwork | Missing key opponent arguments |
| **1.4** | Model critique, layered rebuttals | Definitional challenges | Not pushing back on opponent model |
| **2.2** | Burden analysis, feasibility | Advanced strategic moves | Missing counterfactual positioning |

## Key Insights for Feedback Generation

### 1. **Position Determines "Good" vs "Bad"**

The SAME behavior can be:
- ✅ **Praised** for Position 1.1: "Good job establishing framework"
- ❌ **Criticized** for Position 1.4: "This should have been done by your first speaker"

### 2. **Third Speakers Have Two Modes**

#### **Reply Speeches (4 min):**
- Focus: Weighing, clash, crystallization
- Expectation: NO new arguments
- Key skill: Comparative analysis

#### **Regular Third Constructive (5 min+):**
- Focus: Rebuttal + new content
- Expectation: Balance offense and defense
- Key skill: Layered rebuttals

### 3. **Teamwork Expectations Escalate**

- **1.1**: No teamwork expected (they're first)
- **1.2**: Must extend first speaker (28 mentions)
- **1.3+**: Must integrate entire team narrative

### 4. **Counter Set-Up Migration**

- **1.1**: Expected to BUILD counter set-up
- **1.4**: Expected to ATTACK opponent's counter set-up
- Different evaluation criteria for same concept!

### 5. **Signposting is Universal**

All positions get reminded: "Don't forget to signpost!"
But intensity decreases with more advanced students (2.x positions)

### 6. **Hook Evolution**

- **1.1**: Hook mentioned but not emphasized
- **2.4**: Hook gets detailed critique (length, clichés, impact)
- More advanced students held to higher standards

## Implications for LLM Prompt Design

### 1. **Position Must Be a Primary Input**

The LLM prompt MUST include:
```
speaker_position: "Prop 1" | "Prop 2" | "Prop 3" | "Opp 1" | "Opp 2" | "Opp 3" | "Reply"
speech_type: "constructive" | "reply" | "summary"
speech_duration: number (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 minutes)
```

### 2. **Different Evaluation Criteria by Position**

The prompt must instruct the LLM:

```
IF position == "Prop 1" OR "Opp 1":
  - Evaluate framework/counter set-up quality
  - Do NOT critique absence of rebuttal
  - Do NOT expect teamwork/extension
  - Focus on definition and strategic framing

ELSE IF position == "Prop 2" OR "Opp 2":
  - REQUIRE reference to first speaker
  - Evaluate extension quality
  - Expect some rebuttal
  - Expect new arguments

ELSE IF position == "Prop 3" OR "Opp 3" AND speech_type == "reply":
  - Evaluate weighing and comparative analysis
  - CRITIQUE any new substantive arguments
  - Focus on clash selection
  - Expect crystallization

ELSE IF position == "Prop 3" OR "Opp 3" AND speech_type == "constructive":
  - Evaluate layered rebuttals
  - Expect attack on opponent model
  - Still expect some new content
  - Focus on definitional challenges

ELSE IF position in ["2.2", "2.3", "2.4"]:
  - Higher sophistication expected
  - Burden analysis
  - Feasibility analysis
  - Advanced strategic moves
```

### 3. **Position-Specific Rubric Weights**

| Rubric | 1.1 Weight | 1.2 Weight | 1.3 Reply | 1.4 Weight |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Time Management | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| POI Engagement | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 (N/A) | 1.0 |
| Delivery & Style | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| Argument Completeness | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.5 | 0.7 |
| Theory Application | 1.2 | 1.0 | 0.8 | 1.0 |
| Rebuttal Effectiveness | 0.0 (N/A) | 0.8 | 1.5 | 1.5 |
| Teamwork & Extension | 0.0 (N/A) | 1.5 | 1.2 | 1.0 |
| Feedback Implementation | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

### 4. **Position-Aware Comment Templates**

Each position needs different comment structure templates with position-specific sections.

---

## Conclusion

**Teacher feedback is NOT one-size-fits-all.** The same speech delivered in different positions would receive dramatically different feedback. An LLM-based feedback system MUST be position-aware to generate authentic, pedagogically sound feedback that matches teacher expectations.

The key is recognizing that debate is a **team sport with specialized roles**, and evaluation criteria must reflect each role's unique responsibilities.
