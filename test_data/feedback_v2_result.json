      "Time Management": "The speech was only 57 seconds long, which is significantly under the expected 8 minutes. This suggests the speech was incomplete.",
      "POI Engagement": "The speaker took one POI, which is appropriate, but the response was more of a dismissal than a structured rebuttal.",
      "Delivery & Style": "The opening was confusing and off-topic. The tone was overly casual and lacked the formal structure and persuasive language expected in a debate.",
      "Argument Completeness": "Arguments were presented as a list of assertions without reasoning, evidence, or impact analysis. Claims were hyperbolic and unsupported.",
      "Theory Application": "The speech lacked a clear framework, signposting, or any recognizable debate structure. It did not define the terms of the motion or establish a clear burden for the proposition.",
      "Rebuttal Effectiveness": "Not applicable for the first speaker.",
      "Teamwork & Extension": "Not applicable for the first speaker.",
      "Feedback Implementation": "Assuming a neutral baseline as no prior feedback was provided."

  "strategic_overview": {
    "hook_and_signposting": "The opening was ineffective, starting with a confusing comment about a recording failure instead of a hook related to the motion. The speech lacked any signposting, making it difficult for the audience to follow the intended structure or identify the key arguments being presented.",
    "strategic_assessment": "As the first speaker, the primary role is to establish a clear case for your side. This speech did not fulfill that role. It presented a series of disconnected and unsubstantiated claims about the world's problems without organizing them into coherent arguments. The core task of defining the debate and laying a solid foundation for the proposition was not achieved.",
    "missing_arguments": "The case was missing a clear framework. A stronger approach would be to define what 'crying' represents (e.g., a state of justified despair, a rejection of toxic optimism) and then structure arguments around distinct themes like irreversible environmental damage, social fragmentation, or existential technological risks."

      "issue": "The speech begins with an irrelevant comment about a recording failure, which wastes the crucial opening seconds and undermines your credibility.",
      "recommendation": "Always start with a powerful, motion-relevant hook. For this motion, you could begin with: 'We are told to look on the bright side, to find the silver lining. But our proposition today is that such optimism is a dangerous delusion. We are here to argue that the only rational response to the state of our world is to cry.'"

      "issue": "You list a series of problems ('forest fires, landslides... AI that will kill everyone') as unsupported assertions. The hyperbolic language makes the claims easy for the opposition to dismiss.",
      "recommendation": "Structure these ideas into a formal argument. For example: 'Our first point is on the acceleration of irreversible environmental collapse. This isn't just about isolated incidents; it's about crossing systemic tipping points which threaten global stability. The scale of this crisis alone justifies a profound sense of loss.'"

      "recommendation": "Provide a clear weighing mechanism. Argue that progress in areas like education is meaningless if it's happening on a planet facing existential threats. Your metric should be that survival and stability must precede other forms of progress, and since those foundations are threatened, any other progress is moot."

      "issue": "The claim that 'More people get killed right now' is a broad, factually questionable statement that damages your credibility, as many metrics of violence have declined.",
      "recommendation": "Be more precise with your claims. Instead of focusing on the number of people killed, focus on the *scale of risk*. Argue that while deaths from conventional war may be down, the risk of a civilization-ending catastrophe from climate change or advanced AI is unprecedentedly high."
