## Scoring Scale Overview

All rubrics use the same 6-point scale:

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **N/A** | Not Applicable | Not applicable for this speech type or role |
| **1** | Unobserved | The skill was not demonstrated at all |
| **2** | Needs Extended Support | Student attempted but needs heavy scaffolding |
| **3** | Competent with Guidance | Can execute with minimal coaching ⭐ **This is "good"** |
| **4** | Independent Proficiency | Can execute independently without prompting |
| **5** | Exceptional Mastery | Exceeds grade-level expectations |

**IMPORTANT:** A score of **3 is NOT "barely passing"** - it represents **competent execution**. The scale is achievement-based, not percentage-based.

## Key Principles for Scoring

1. **3 is "Good"** - A score of 3 represents competent execution, not barely passing
2. **Be Position-Aware** - First speakers get N/A for rebuttal and teamwork
3. **Judge Against Grade Level** - A 5 means exceeding expectations for secondary students, not perfection
4. **Each Rubric is Independent** - Great delivery doesn't compensate for weak arguments (and vice versa)
5. **Context Matters** - Consider speech duration, debate format, and prior feedback history

---

## Quick Reference: Scoring Checklist

When scoring a speech, ask these questions for each rubric:

| Rubric | Key Question |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time Management** | Did they hit the target time (within acceptable range)? |
| **POI Engagement** | Did they offer/accept strategic, relevant POIs? |
| **Delivery & Style** | Was the delivery clear, engaging, and persuasive? |
| **Argument Completeness** | Did arguments have claims, reasoning, examples, impacts, AND implications? |
| **Theory Application** | Did they use taught debate techniques (framing, weighing, mechanism, etc.)? |
| **Rebuttal Effectiveness** | Did they directly clash with specific opponent arguments? |
| **Teamwork & Extension** | Did they extend and build on teammate's arguments? |
| **Feedback Implementation** | Did they address issues from previous feedback? |
